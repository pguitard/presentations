Presentations
=============

This is a repository containing the very few presentations I give. Each dated directory contains a presentation in PDF and Keynote format, along with a submodule link to any relevant code respositories, if applicable.

To use
------

Clone the repo, then initialize and recursively pull all the submodules.

Following [Jason Brennan](https://github.com/jbrennan/presentations)'s idea, I'm sharing my presentations on Github. I invite you to do the same.
